# quadratic-primes 
Determines how many sequential primes can be generated by a quadratic formula.

Specifically, given a formula of the form:  

`n^2 + a*n + b`  

Determine how many consecutive primes are generated by testing incrementing integer values of `n` starting from 0.

For example, `n^2 âˆ’ 79n + 1601` produces 80 sequential primes.  
Here, a = -79, and b = 1601.

This project was completed for [Project Euler - Problem 27](https://projecteuler.net/problem=27).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
